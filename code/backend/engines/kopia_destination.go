// would silently overwrite the other's (or a separately selected file), while
// every item still reports restored. Restic keeps each item's archived path,
// so it is not affected. Giving each folder its own subfolder would mean
// Replicaro laying out a restore Kopia did not make; selected-file naming is
// the only destination translation Replicaro does for Kopia. So the request
// is refused instead. A single folder and several regular files stay allowed.
